		<div class="p1">1. What is the difference between a web server
			and a web container?</div>
		<div class="p2">Web Server: A server which is capable of
			handling requests, sent by a client and respond back with a HTTP
			responce.</div>
		<br>
		<div class="p2">Web Container is used to manage the components
			like servlets, JSP. It is a part of the web server.</div>
		<br> <br>
		<div class="p1">2. What is servlet?</div>
		<div class="p2">A servlet is server-side java code that can
			handle http requests and return dynamic content - Servlets are
			managed by a servlet engine or container. Each request that comes in
			results in the spawning of a new thread that runs a servlet
			(eliminating the cost of creating a new process every time). One of
			the best known open source servlet contaner is Tomcat.</div>
		<br> <br>
		<div class="p1">3. How do web servers and web containers
			interact with servlets?</div>

		<div class="p2">
			Servers that support servlets have as a helper app a servlet
			container.<br> When a request comes to the web server, if the
			server sees the request is for a servlet, it passes the request data
			to the servlet container.<br> The servlet container locates the
			servlet, creates request and response objects and passes them to the
			servlet, and returns to the web server the response stream that the
			servlet produces.<br> The web server sends the response back to
			the client browser to be rendered.<br>
		</div>
		<br> <br>

		<div class="p1">4. Who creates request objects?</div>
		<div class="p2">The servlet container create request and
			response objects and passes them to servlets.</div>
		<br> <br>

		<div class="p1">5. What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			There are 6 stated in the servlet lifecycle.
			<ol>
				<li>Load servlet class (Class c = Class.forname(...))</li>
				<li>2. Instantiate servlet (c.newInstance());</li>
				<li>3. init() called only once in the servlet's life. Must
					complete before Container can call service().</li>
				<li>4. service() (called for each request, each request runs in
					a separate thread)</li>
				<li>5. destroy() (called only once)</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<br> <br>
		<div class="p1">6. Who calls init and when?</div>
		<div class="p2">init() is called first by the servlet container
			to indicate to a servlet that the servlet is being placed into
			service.</div>
		<br> <br>

		<div class="p1">7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you
			override?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			init(): If you have initialization code(like getting a database
			connection or registering yourself with other objects), then you'll
			override the init() method in the servlet class. <br> <br>
			service(): We can not override the service() method. Service
			implementation from HTTPServlet worry about calling the right one. <br>
			<br> doGet() or doPost(): Whicever one(s) you override tells the
			container what you support. If you don't override doPost(), for
			example, then you're telling the container that this servlet does not
			support HTTP post requests. <br> <br>
		</div>



		<div class="p1">8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</div>
		<div class="p2">Servlets are intrinsically multithreaded. This
			meand a single instance can be assessed by more than one thread. if
			the container received multiple requests for one servlet
			simultaneously, the service() method of that servlet will be executed
			concurrently in multiple threads.</div> <br> <br>



		<div class="p1">9. What are the implications of this for servlet
			instance variables?</div>
		<div class="p2">Due to the thread safety in servlet it is
			advised to not make instance variables. SInce servlet lifetime is
			controlled by the server so the duration of a servlet isntance is
			uncertain, as may be the number of instance and the number of thread
			involed/</div>
