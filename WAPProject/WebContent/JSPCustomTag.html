		<div class="p1">1 Rewrite the JSP page in the first demo
			(forEach) to use scripting instead of the JSTL forEach</div>
		<div class="p2">

		</div>

		<br> <br>
		<div class="p1">2 How do custom tags relate to JSTL?</div>
		<div class="p2">JSTL provides new tags for JSPs that reduce
			scripting. JSTL uses the custom tag api, but have become a standard
			library, essentially a part of JSP language.</div>
		<br> <br>


		<div class="p1">3 What is the role of the URI in the TLD and the
			taglib directive?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			"uri" element in the TLD is a unique name for the tag library. It
			does not need to represent any actual location. It simply has to be a
			name- the same name we use in the laglib directive. <br>
		</div>
		<br> <br>

		<div class="p1">4 What is a tag handler class?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			A tage handler class is basically a JavaBeans class, it should
			contain set of set method and set of get methods. <br> All the
			attributes of custom tag must be used as properties of data members
			in tag handler class in the same order in which they appear. <br>Every
			tag handler class must extend a predefined class called
			javax.servlet.jsp.target.TagSupport.
		</div>
		<br> <br>

		<div class="p1">5 What is the role of attribute setters in a tag
			handler class?</div>
		<div class="p2">All propertied of a tag handler instance exposed
			as attributes will be initialized by the container using the
			appropriate setter methods before the instance can be used to perform
			the action methods. it is responsibility of user code, be it
			scriptlets, JavaBeans code, or code inside custom tags , to not
			invoke these setter methods, as doing otherwise would infere with the
			container knowledge.</div>
		<br>

		<div class="p1">6 What is the role of the doTag() method in a
			tag handler class?</div>
		<div class="p2">The SimpleTag interface provides a simple
			doTag() mehtod, which is called one and only once for any given tag
			invocation. All tag ligic, interaction, body evaluations etc. are to
			be performed in this single method. Thus, simple tag handlers have
			the squivalent power of body tag, but with a much simpler lifecycle
			and interface.</div>
		<br> <br>

		<div class="p1">7 What does the operation
			getJspContext()getOut()write(“Hi Bob”) do when called in a doTag()
			method?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			We can not write it because it gives the error <q>Type mismatch:
				cannot convert from void to JspWriter</q> It can be write it like:<br>
			JspWriter outa =getJspContext().getOut();<br> outa.write("Hi
			Bob"); <br> <br>
		</div>



		<div class="p1">8 What does the operation
			getJspBody()invoke(null) do when called in a doTag() method?</div>
		<div class="p2">When getJspBody()invoke(null) is called , it is
			the output resulting from the execution of the tag body's JSP content
			that gets passed to the client, not the JSP code itself.</div>
