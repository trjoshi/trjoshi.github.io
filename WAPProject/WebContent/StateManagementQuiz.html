			<b>State Management Quiz</b>
		<p style="line-height: 30px; border: 1px solid black;">
		<div class="p1">1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the
			problems?</div>
		<div class="p2">An HTTP post can be bookmarked, but since a
			bookmark only consists of the URL. all of the form parameters will be
			lost.This will often mean that the web server doesn't know what to do
			with the request, since it was expecting some form parameters.</div>
		<br> <br>


		<div class="p1">2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?</div>
		<div class="p2">The RequestDispatcher interface provides the
			faclity of dispatching the request to another resource it may be
			html, servlet or jsp.This interface can also be used to include the
			content of another resource also. It is one of the way of servlet
			collaboration.</div>
		<br> <br>


		<div class="p1">3. What is the difference between redirect and
			request dispatch?</div>

		<div class="p2">
			Request Dispatch - Dispatch the request to some other JSP or Servlet,
			user will not aware of this and finally response will go from where
			the request is dispatched. <br> Request Redirect - Redirect
			request where user will find the URL change and the response will
			come from the redirected servlet of JSP.

		</div>
		<br> <br>

		<div class="p1">4. What is an attribute ?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			An object bound into one of the three servlet API objects <br>1)
			HttpServletRequest<br> 2) HttpSession<br> 3) ServletContext<br>
			Is a name value pair<br> 1) value has type Object 2) name is
			String
		</div>
		<br> <br>


		<div class="p1">5. What is the difference between attributes and
			parameters?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			1. Parameter represents data received as part of request where as
			attributed represent data stored by servlet for another servlet
			involed in processing the same request.<br> 2. Parameters
			represent string data where as attributed can be any type of objects
			<br> Parameters can only be used by the servlet whereas
			attributed are stored, removed, replaced and read by the servlets.

		</div>

		<br> <br>


		<div class="p1">6. What are dangers of using attributes?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			<ul>
				<li>Shared by every servlet and every request in the
					application</li>
				<li>Like nuclear power
					<ul>
						<li>very powerful</li>
						<li>have to be careful</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Not thread safe
					<ul>
						<li>Nor session attributes</li>
						<li>Only request attributes thread safe</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<br> <br>


		<div class="p1">7. What does it mean to say that http is
			stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</div>
		<div class="p2">
			HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that after a web server
			responds to a request, there is no memory of the request or who sent
			it. To maintain a client-server conversation, it is necessary to get
			past this barrier. In the world of servlets, keeping track of client
			identity was accomplished using client cookies; keeping track of
			client was accomplished by maintaining an HttpSession. These
			activities are conducted behind the scenes by the servlet container.
			<br> <br> <br>
		</div>



		<div class="p1">8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining
			state information (count each attribute scope as one method).</div>
		<div class="p2">



			Container managed state (3 scopes): <br>5 ways to maintain state
			<ol>
				<li>request scope: destroyed when servlet finishes processing
					request</li>
				<li>session scope: destroyed when user closes browser</li>
				<li>application scope destroyed when Container stopped.</li>
				<li>Cookies saved on browser, temporary (deleted when the
					browser closes) permanent</li>
				<li>Hidden fields on a form</li>


			</ol>
		</div>
		<br> <br>



		<div class="p1">9. How long does a session last?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			<b>Client side</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Browser discards all temporary cookies when it closes</li>
				<li>Every tab or window of browser will have access to all
					cookies</li>
			</ol>
			<br> <b>Server side - 3 ways for container to remove
				sessions</b>
			<ol>
				<li>session timeout in the DD</li>
				<li>session.setMaxInactiveInterval(20*60); //seconds</li>
				<li>session.invalidate(); //immediate</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="p1">10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie
			last?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			Cookies are text files stored on the client computer and they are
			kept for various information tracking putpose. <br> There are
			two types of cookie life times <br>temporary cookie
			<ol>

				<li>browser removes when it closes</li>
				<li>this is default</li>
				<li>session cookies are like this</li>
			</ol>
			permanent cookie - a cookie that has a max age set
		</div>
		<br> <br>
		<div class="p1">11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</div>
		<div class="p2">
			Changing a URL to the required format. URL rewriting allows URLs to
			be more easily remembered by the user. When the URL is entered into
			the web server, the URL rewrite engine modifies the syntax behind the
			scenes to enable the appropriate web page or database item to be
			retrived. <br> For example, to look up the definition for
			"path", a user frieldly URL might look like
			computerlanguage.com/path. The rewrite engine could trun it into the
			following syntax: computerlanguages.com/results.php?definition=path.
		</div>
		<br> <br>
		<div class="p1">12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’
			for the maintaining state demo?</div>
		<div class="p2">On server side servlet check whether the session
			is new or not If there are no session exists then it return NULL.</div>
